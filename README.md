# SkriptDocsGenerator
This plugin is an alternative of [SkriptHubDocsTool](https://github.com/SkriptHub/SkriptHubDocsTool), which I think needs some updates.<br>
It allows you to generate documentation automatically in JSON files, ready to send on popular Skript documentation websites !

## How to use ?
*Wiki is now available [here](https://github.com/Skylyxx/SkriptDocsGenerator/wiki) !*
- Put the [latest release](https://github.com/Skylyxx/SkriptDocsGenerator/releases/latest) in your **plugins/** folder.
- Start your server 
- Run the **/skriptdocsgenerator** command. JSON files are generated in **/plugins/SkriptDocsGenerator/**
- Now, you can copy the content of your JSON file on [SkriptHub's](https://skripthub.net/dashboard/) or [SkUnity's](https://docs.skunity.com/admin/) dashboard.
