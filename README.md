# SkriptDocsGenerator
This plugin is an alternative of [SkriptHubDocsTool](https://github.com/SkriptHub/SkriptHubDocsTool), which I think needs some updates.

## Installation
- Put the [latest release](https://github.com/Skylyxx/SkriptDocsGenerator/releases/latest) in your **plugins/** folder.
- Start your server and run the **/skriptdocsgenerator** command. Files are generated in **/plugins/SkriptDocsGenerator**
